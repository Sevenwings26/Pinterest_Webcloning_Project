# Pinterest_Webcloning_Project
My front-end web development projects with SQI included cloning sophisticated websites and collaborating as a developer with UI/UX designers.
I utilized HTML, CSS, and integrated Bootstrap to create modals. While the responsiveness aspect is still being fine-tuned, my project effectively showcased my proficiency in replicating the visual elements and features of the webpages.
The duplicated pages consist of the Landing (pinterest.com), About, Press, Business, Login, and User Account.
On the Landing page, if you click the login button, a modal will appear. You can input text into the email and password fields, then click login to be directed to the user page.
